<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I currently work as a Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft. I received a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/">Prof. Gauri Joshi</a> and <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oyagan/">Prof. Osman YaÄŸan</a>. My Thesis <i>"Structured and Correlated Multi-Armed Bandits: Algorithms, Theory and Applications"</i>, 
    studied sequential learning algorithms in presence of noisy and correlated/structured observations.
I like to work on problems involving Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization and Performance modeling. 
I am interested about the applications of these problems in A/B testing, experiment design, recommendation systems, model selection in ML, robust machine learning and metric design. </p>

<p>At Microsoft, I have been working on productization of LLMs for Windows co-pilot, new features in Bing Chat, text prediction in Edge browser (EN and non-EN languages). I have also been involved in inference latency optimization of LLMs.</p>

<p>At CMU, I explored problems in online learning and statistical inference. I designed and analysed online learning algorithms to solve sequential decision making problems. 
In my PhD, I did some work on Correlated Multi-Armed Bandits (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03959">1</a>, <a href=
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05904">2</a>, <a href=
    "https://sidsamarth.github.io/BAIcorrelated.pdf">3</a>), Stuctured Multi-Armed Bandits (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08164">4</a>) and 
Active Distribution Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05334">5</a>). In these works, I have shown the use of our proposed algorithms for the application of recommendation systems and combinatorial online resource allocation problems (<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/corr_comb_bandits.pdf">6</a>).  </p>
<p>I did a couple of industry internships during my PhD. During Summer 2019, I worked as an intern with the prediction team at Uber ATG to develop uncertainty aware metrics and safety-oriented predictions for autonomous vehicle. In summer 2021, I worked as an intern with the search team at Amazon, 
where I studied the problem of selecting best among the available search engines for the query typed in by the customer using session-aware MDP based models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02362">7</a>).</p> 


During my undergrad at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, I had a chance to work on resource allocation problems for large scale content delivery networks
 (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3289324">8</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02391">9</a>) with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/"> 
Prof. Sharayu Moharir </a>.</p>
<p>Here is a link to my <a href = "https://sidsamarth.github.io/samarthCV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from research, I love to run, bike and play tennis, squash, table tennis and soccer. I try to follow tennis and soccer quite regularly.  </p>
