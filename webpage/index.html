<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently a final year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. 
I am advised by <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/">Prof. Gauri Joshi</a> and <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oyagan/">Prof. Osman YaÄŸan</a>. 
I like to work on problems involving Statistics, Machine Learning, Information Theory and Performance modeling. 
I am interested about the applications of these problems in A/B testing, experiment design, recommendation systems, data analytics, robust machine learning and model selection in ML.
During Summer 2019, I worked as an intern with the prediction team at Uber ATG to develop safety-oriented predictions for traffic actors around an autonomous vehicle. In summer 2021, I worked as an intern with the search team at Amazon, 
where I studied the problem of selecting best among the available search engines for the query typed in by the customer using session-aware MDP based models.</p> 
<p>Broadly, I am interested in online learning and statistical inference. I like to design and analyse online learning algorithms to solve sequential decision making problems. 
In my PhD so far, I have done some work on Correlated Multi-Armed Bandits (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03959">1</a>, <a href=
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05904">2</a>, <a href=
    "http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/samarthg/BAIcorrelated.pdf">3</a>), Stuctured Multi-Armed Bandits (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08164">4</a>) and 
Active Distribution Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05334">5</a>). In these works, I have shown the use of our proposed algorithms for the application of recommendation systems. 
These days I am working on using these bandit algorithms for model selection in ML and combinatoraial online resource allocation problems. 
I am also quite interested in performance modeling of computer systems. 
During my undergrad at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, I had a chance to work on resource allocation problems for large scale content delivery networks
 (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3289324">6</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02391">7</a>) with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/"> 
Prof. Sharayu Moharir </a>.</p>
<p>Here is a link to my <a href = "http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/samarthg/samarthCV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from research, I love to run, bike and play Tennis, Squash, Table Tennis and Soccer. I try to follow Tennis and Soccer quite regularly.  </p>
